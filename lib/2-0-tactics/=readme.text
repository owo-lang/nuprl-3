This directory contains the tactic collection from Nuprl 2.0.  The 3.0
tactic collection is the same but for a few bug fixes.  The file
nuprl:doc;tactics.text describes the 2.0 collection and the fixes.  The
2.0 collection can be loaded (compiled) using the file load.ml
(compile.ml).  It should be loaded (compiled) on top of the 3.0
collection (which is loaded with the system by default).
